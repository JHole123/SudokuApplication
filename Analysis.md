# C# Sudoku Application Analysis
## AQA NEA Computer Science Programming Project

**Summary** The sudoku application will provide systems for the analytical and bruteforce solution of sudoku puzzles; random generation of sudoku puzzles with varying difficulty; the use of analytical solving to provide hints to the player; a graphical interface for interacting with these systems, and a library for sudoku solving and generation. This document delineates specific requirements and recommendations for the criteria of this application. It does not include the specific design of the program itself.

# 1 Notes

Segment refers to any section within a sudoku grid which can only contain some *n* (1..9) once. These are rows, columns, or the 3x3 grids. The rows and columns will be referred to as segments of type "linear" (referring to their commonality with lines), and the 3x3 grids as type "block".

# 2 Sudoku Library

The library will act as the "engine" of the program - it will provide functionality for solving and generating sudoku puzzles given a particular format, but will not provide immediately user-comprehensible output. The presentation of the sudoku program, and the way in which the program displays the information, is up to the developer using the library. The following subsections will describe the composite functionality of the library: solving and generation. 

## 2.1 Sudoku Solving

The solving of a sudoku is a relatively trivial problem, especially with bruteforce methods. However, a requirement of the solution is provide a hint: bruteforce solution is not conducive to providing a logical, human-intelligible hint to a stuck player. Therefore, the solution must use both analytical and bruteforce functionality, along with providing a reason for the move in the case of the analytical solving. Bruteforce solving is still required in cases where the sudoku is solvable but not human-solvable, and is sped up by using the functionality of the analytical solution as heuristics.

### 2.1.1 General Requirements

This list describes **general** requirements of sudoku solving. Requirements specific to analytical or bruteforce implementation are not listed here, rather just the requirements of their inputs and outputs.

- **Required** *The analytical solution must be able to return a single-tile, validated move.* The analytical solution, unlike the bruteforce one, can provide a linear solution to the problem. This must be utilised to provide a uniquely analytical function of only solving one more tile. Solving only one tile is crucial to the provision of hints to stuck human players.
- **Recommended** *The single-tile move analytical solution must provide a reason.* The solution needs to provide a reason for why it has picked that number for that tile. This reason will be used to supply hints to the player. The reason does not necessarily need to be human-understandable (i.e. it may use an ID system). The reason must provide the tiles which led it to the conclusion, for developer-specific implementation of graphical display for hints.
- **Required** *The bruteforce solution must provide a completely solved puzzle, given the puzzle is solvable.* The bruteforce solution can not provide a reasonable chain of linear moves, and as such it must provide a complete solution rather than a step-by-step. The bruteforce solution is preferred for cases of simply solving the solution without any regard for providing hints or being human-intelligible.

#### 2.1.1.1 Analytical Solving Requirements

*Requirements that are to do with the working of the analytical solution, i.e. logically driven solving.*

- **Recommended** *The analytical solution must be able to provide a technique for at least most human techniques.* This will allow hints to be useful for human players looking to develop their abilities in sudoku by showing them precisely where particular techniques can be used. This allows the hints to properly fulfil their purpose as an assisted learning tool for the player. Specifically, "most" is defined as 90% in terms of frequency.
- **Required** *The analytical solution must carry out full workings in a timely manner.* Sudoku solvers can be very fast, but we must account for the fact that our system will additionally be returning hints and using extensive human-like technique. To account for this, a reasonable time requirement is 500ms. This is excessive for a program simply concerned with the solution of the sudoku, but not for one with additional features such as hints and GUI.

#### 2.1.1.2 Bruteforce Solving Requirements
*Requirements that are to do with the working of the bruteforce solution, i.e. computationally driven solving.*

- **Recommended** *The bruteforce solution must use heuristics for optimisation.* This includes techniques such as using small analytical methods for pruning, and ordering of branches in a computationally reductive manner - for example, trying squares that have the least possibilities first will reduce the overall number of computations the bruteforce solver must complete. 
- **Recommended** *The bruteforce solution must use memory stores for optimisation.* Usage of caches and various memory stores of things already computed is very effective in bruteforce solutions to reduce the number of computations that need to be done by simply not repeating any. This method is generally slightly more memory intensive, however this is not an issue on any modern computer where the additional memory usage is in a few megabytes (a trivial amount), and instead saves on the bottlenecking factor in sudoku solving, which is processing.
- **Required** *Must throw an error if multiple valid solutions are found.* Since the bruteforce solving will be used in the sudoku generation part of the library, it must be fit for that purpose. Multiple solutions from the same puzzle constitutes an invalid puzzle and must be rejected, as that means the player may solve a sudoku correctly but will be told they are wrong as it does not fit the solution given by the computer or the computer will not know which solution to try to apply to the player.

### 2.1.2 Analytical Solution

*This subsection discusses the methodology of analytical solving.*

There are a variety of different sudoku techniques employed by humans to analytically solve sudokus. These will be extensively employed in the analytical solution as employing human techniques is naturally more conducive to returning human-intelligible hints and guidance. A variety of sudoku techniques can be found [*here*](https://www.stolaf.edu/people/hansonr/sudoku/explain.htm#:~:text=The%20Sudoku%20Assistant%20uses%20several,%2C%20almost%2Dlocked%20set%20analysis.). A lot of these techniques will be explained in the following text body, but note that not every technique on the source will be used. Techniques that are particularly unamenable to computational methods are mentioned, but otherwise ignored.

#### 2.1.2.1 Singles Analysis

*This subsubsection discusses the analysis of single candidates within a puzzle.*

- *Simple Checking* By keeping a store of the numbers that *could* go in any square (candidate values), and simply filling in a number when there is only one number that could go in a particular square, we can entirely solve easier sudoku puzzles. It is also the foundation of all the analytical methods, and the bruteforce solution will employ this component of the analytical solution for validation.
- *Cross-Hatch Scanning* Given some segment *k*, if some number *n* only appears across all squares within *k* once, then in whichever square that *n* appears, it must be *n*. If there is only one square which is valid for *n*, that square must contain *n*.
- *Generalised Method Rule* For some intersection of *A* and *B*, *Q*, if some *n* is not possible within either of *A* or *B*, then it necessarily implies that *n* is contained within *Q*, given that *Q* contains a possibility for *n*. This is because a particular segment *must* contain *n* - so if *A* does not contain *n* outside of *Q*, it must be contained within *Q*. 

#### 2.1.2.2 Doubles Analysis

*This subsubsection discusses the analysis of double candidates within a puzzle.*

- *Segment Range Checking* Given some segment *k* of type block and overlapping segment *l* of type linear, if some *n* appears only within the intersection of *k* and *l*, *Q*, and nowhere else within *k*, then it can also not be contained within the *l* that is not *Q*. This is similar to the process of the *Generalised Method Rule* - that is to say, *k* must contain *n*, so *n* cannot be present in *Â¬Q^l*. This rule is applicable with reversed types: when *k* is of type linear and *l* is of type block.  

## 2.2 Sudoku Generation

The generation of a new sudoku puzzle for a user to solve is significantly more computationally expensive than sudoku solving, although it is far simpler logically. Unlike solving, there is no singular algorithm which can be used for simple generation, and it rather relies on pure bruteforce using solving to validate - or far more likely, to invalidate - each attempt. There are some algorithmic ways to create puzzles, but they generally create similar puzzles to a reference rather than generating entirely unique ones. However, there are ways in which to "squeeze blood out of a stone" - that is to say, create as many puzzles out of as little computation as possible. Good ways to optimise this were described in the top answer in [*this StackOverflow post*](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/56149/how-can-i-generate-sudoku-puzzles) by badweasel. More detail on how this will performed in my program will be given in the design documentation. Here are some general requirements:

- **Required** *The generation will save patterns to generate sudokus.* These patterns can be made to use up to 36 puzzles each, so even a small store of around 100 unique patterns will allow 3600 functionally unique puzzles, significantly reducing the chance that a player will have a puzzle repeat. Keeping the patterns stored will mean that a player will also not have to wait several seconds for a puzzle to be generated.
- **Recommended** *The generation will have variance for difficulties.* This means that puzzles that are intended to have a lower difficulty will have more numbers filled in initially. This allows the user to decide what level of difficulty they wish to have on their sudoku, allowing it to fulfil the needs of both people with less experience in sudoku and those with more experience. Having varying difficulties means that the saved patterns will have to be marked with their respective difficulty when they are saved.

# 3 Graphical Interface

The graphical interface is not something in which analysis is particularly necessary. However, in spirit of being compendious, specific UI principles will be expounded upon. It is important to note that, due to the nature of UI to be optional, most of these listed requirements are more optional and not essential to the running of the program.
